Extract the File in desired location
Update the path permanently (the following is for Windows 10):

ii. Type the path Ex: C:\Users\WindowsUserName\flutter\bin.

Verify Flutter Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Run: flutter doctor
This checks dependencies and shows you what needs to be fixed (example: installing Android Studio, SDKs, etc.)

Install Dart Plugin

You don’t need to install Dart separately — it comes bundled with Flutter.
When you install Flutter, Dart SDK is included in flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk.

Install an IDE (Optional but recommended)

Visual Studio Code → install Flutter and Dart extensions.( Ctrl+ Shift +X)
OR
Android Studio → install Flutter and Dart plugins from Preferences
